Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)

Spring Semester 2024

Trade and Sustainability (Lecture + Exercise)

In this course, we will look at how global trade impacts the environment and economic development. Using case studies of different products like soy, solar panels, and steel, we will look at trade between Europe and Brazil, China, the US and more. We will understand how different actors including country governments and businesses react to these challenges, and what kinds of regulations affect global supply chains. By the end of the course, students will be able to compare how these cases align – or not – with theories about international trade. They will understand under which contexts globalization has positive or negative environmental impacts, and consider supply chain management in terms of environmental and reputational risks. They will also better understand regulations like CBAM, the CSDDD, and Lieferkettengesetz, and how these may help European businesses compete in global markets.
